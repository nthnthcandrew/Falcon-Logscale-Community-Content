## Airlock Digital
Airlock enables you to easily create and manage secure allowlists (formerly application whitelists) in dynamically changing computing environments.

Unlike signature based file blocking (blocklisting) such as antivirus, Airlock only allows files it has been instructed to trust, to run.â€‚If the file is not in the allowlist it cannot run, regardless if a file is known good, bad or indifferent. This proactively prevents malicious code from running on your system, before any damage occurs.

This package contains a parser, three dashboards. 

Within the dashboard there are multiple searches/queries that can be used to visualise data ingested from Airlock Digital.

Log integration mode recommended for this package:

# Falcon LogScale Community Content

**Falcon LogScale Community Content** is a community-driven open source project designed to assist LogScale users with ingesting differing log sources, working with that data and extracting immediate value from those logs and is not a formal CrowdStrike product. As such it carries no formal support, expressed or implied.

Extended documentation is also available via the [wiki](https://github.com/nthnthcandrew/Falcon-Logscale-Community-Content/wiki) for this repository.
